# Fabrica Celeste
3D blocky game about factories in the sky or something.

Very very very early in dev right now (can't even call it a game honestly)

## How to build and run
*You will need vcpkg installed on your machine, see [how to install here](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd)*
```
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build build
./build/fabrica
```
